# Contributing to AdamRMS

Thanks for you interest in contributing to the AdamRMS project!

All contributions are covered by the existing project licence - please have a look at this to ensure you're familiar with it before contributing. 

When doing so, we ask that you follow the guidelines below:

## Writing Commits

When writing commits use the **present/imperative tense**, and make sure the message is **descriptive** enough.

**✔ Good**

```
Add new integration with network printers
```

**❌ Bad**

```
Changed printers.php
```

Additionally, **please don't make too many commits**. If you can, bundle together similar changes into a single commit.


## Creating Issues

Make sure your issue has a **concise but descriptive title**, and describe your problem in more detail inside the issue.  
If you're reporting a bug, the aim is to help us reproduce it on our end so we can fix it. If you're reporting a feature/enhancement, the aim to help us visualise this feature and why it might be good for the site.

**✔ Good**

```
Projects list not loading

When on the homepage the menu doesn't show the latest list of projects.
```

**❌ Bad**

```
List broken
```

## Making Pull Requests

Similarly to commits, please write your PR title in the present/imperative tense, and describe what problem it fixes.  
Additionally, include the issue number its related to at the end of the title; this makes it easier to track which PRs are related to which issues.

In the PR's description, it would be helpful to write a brief summary of the changes you made, too.
