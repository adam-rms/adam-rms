AdamRMS is an advanced Rental Management System for Theatre, AV & Broadcast, written in PHP with the Twig Templating engine, and deployed using a pre-built docker container.

It is available as a hosted solution or to be self-hosted as a docker container. 

This repo is about the v1 release of the system, a PHP web app using Twig. It is still in active development, but most efforts have moved to the [v2 repo](https://github.com/adam-rms/adam-rms-v2).
