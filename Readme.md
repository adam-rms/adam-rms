## Docker Images

A maintained docker image is provided - hosted on GitHub Packages as [adam-rms/adam-rms](https://github.com/orgs/adam-rms/packages?repo_name=adam-rms). Due to Docker Hub's pricing changes, the Docker Hub images are no longer maintained, but were identical to the GitHub Packages images which are still available to use.

When self-hosting, please pay attention to the license terms of the software you are using. AdamRMS is licenced under AGPLv3, which means changes you make to the source code must be kept open source.
