## Data Processing Statement and Privacy Policy

This section of this document is designed to bring the service into compliance with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which came into force on May 25, 2018.

Data is typically passed to us either by our users directly: for example by signing up to the service and entering their personal details or by entering data into our service such as a resolution or their preference of news outlet, or it is passed to us by organisations hosting conferences using our service and entered by their agents: such as a list of attendees which accounts are generated for or by entering comments about delegate performance for example. 

When users first login or signup they are asked to consent to this document by the system, which records them having done so. 

### Lawful, fair and transparent processing 

1. Individuals have the right to access their personal data and any such requests made to the service shall be dealt with in a timely manner. 
2. All data processed by the service must be done on one of the following lawful bases: consent, contract, legal obligation, vital interests, public task or legitimate interests
3. Where consent is relied upon as a lawful basis for processing data, evidence of opt-in  consent shall be kept with the personal data. 
4. Where communications are sent to individuals based on their consent, the option for the individual to revoke their consent should be clearly available and systems should be in place to ensure such revocation is reflected accurately in the service’s systems.  
5. The service shall ensure that personal data are adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed

### Security
1. The service shall ensure that personal data is stored securely
1.  Some of the service's directors, employees and volunteers have access to some/all of the service's files, access logs, emails and data, which they may view at any time.
2.  To help provide fantastic service and support, certain directors, employees and volunteers may login to any user's account, at any time, without notifying them.
3.  As provided for by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 or any corresponding statute, The Service's directors, employees and volunteers reserve the right to investigate and inspect electronic communications.
4. As required for operational reasons, user data may be released to other users to enable them to execute their role functions - for example your email address will be shared with other users to allow them to contact you in relation to events. 
5. The service may release data for analytical purposes to external providers but this data will either be anonymised or stored in line with this document.
6. When personal data is deleted this should be done safely such that the data is irrecoverable, in liason with the service's storage contractors. 
7. Appropriate back-up and disaster recovery solutions shall be in place. 
8. In the event of a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data, the service shall promptly assess the risk to people’s rights and freedoms and if appropriate report this breach to the ICO in the United Kingdom. 

### Data Storage

As a European Union based service provider we endeavour to store your data within the European Union as per our legal obligations, but we cannot guarantee that it will not leave the European Union for storage, processing or in transit.
