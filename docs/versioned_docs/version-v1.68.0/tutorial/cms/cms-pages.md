## Editing Page Content
---

Page content is based on cards.  
Card content is edited through the standard RMS editor, and files or images can be added to each card.  

Each Card has the following properties:
- Card Title
- Card Colour (Uses the standard bootstrap colour scheme)
- Card Colour Position
- Card size can be adjusted to fit the page and content.

*Editing a CMS page*

When saving the page, provide a revision comment to explain the page changes.  
If you need to revert changes, there is a revision history for each page. This lets you fall back to a specific point in the page history based on its timestamp and comment.
