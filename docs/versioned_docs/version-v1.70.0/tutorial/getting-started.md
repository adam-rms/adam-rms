## Joining a business

Once you’ve created an account, you’ll need to join a business.

If you’ve been given a signup code, pop the code from your AdamRMS administrator into the Business Signup Code box and you’ll be added to that business.
Alternatively, ask your AdamRMS administrator to add you to the business.

You can join other businesses using the business switcher on the dashboard.
