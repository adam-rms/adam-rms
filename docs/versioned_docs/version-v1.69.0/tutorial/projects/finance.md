## Invoices

Invoices are documents you can share with clients that sum up a project. You can customise them to include as much information as you want.  
They can also be used as printouts of project assets.

Invoices are stored in the Invoices and Files tab, and count towards your business file quota.
Every generated invoice is stored, so you can track the history of the project through invoices.
