## Files on AdamRMS
---
Files are stored in an AWS S3 bucket, and references to each file are stored in the files database. The AdamRMS support team limits file storage capacity to reduce AWS costs, so if you need more storage space, please contact AdamRMS support.

## Contributing to the project
---
Since May 2021, AdamRMS has been an open source project. You can browse the code, suggest features and report bugs on Github - https://github.com/bstudios/adam-rms. Check the Contributing Guide for how to contribute code.

## Self-Hosting
---
Currently, AdamRMS doesn’t support self-hosting too well. If you would like to self-host the rms, please contact RMS support and we’ll discuss the best way to support this.
