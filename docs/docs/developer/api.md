## Hosted Solution

*Coming Soon*

## Self-Hosted

When self-hosting the api documentation will be available at `/docs` on your API endpoint.

## Developing Locally

The API is self documenting, using Swagger. When [running the api locally](./repo/api/intro) the documentation is kept upto date, and is available at [`http://localhost:8008/docs`](http://localhost:8008/docs).
