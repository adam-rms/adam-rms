# Developing for the Website

The `docs/` directory contains the public marketing site for the AdamRMS Rental Management System, a [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/) site.

It also serves as the documentation for the site, and its API. It is community maintained and written, and covered by the same licence as the main source code. It is included in the same repo such that changes in the API and features can be included in the same PR.
