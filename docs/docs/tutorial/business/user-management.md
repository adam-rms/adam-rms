*List of users*

To add a user to a business, you can either add them by email (once they have created an account) or use a [signup code](#signup-codes).  
Each user has a role group within the business that is defined by what [permissions](#permissions) they have. They can also have a Role in the business, which is a text entry that can have any value.  

## Permissions
---
AdamRMS has a granular permission system which lets you define exactly what a user can do.

*AdamRMS Permissions*

Throughout this guide permissions have been included in each section, but they are all listed on the permissions page.

Permissions are assigned to a Role Group, which can be created on a per-business basis. By default, businesses have an ‘Administrator’ Role group that has access to all permissions.


## Signup Codes
---
Signup codes are a way for individuals to automatically be added to your business as a specific role Group.

*Business signup codes*

The code is the item users enter to get access to your business.  
AdamRMS tracks how many uses a code has had, and you can receive an email every time a signup code is used.
