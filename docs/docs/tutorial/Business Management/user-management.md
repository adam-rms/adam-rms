# User Management

## Users
---
The Users page lists all users associated with a business.

:::note User Account Permissions

3 - Add a user to a business by EMail  
5 - Remove a user from a business  
6 - Change the role of a user in a business  
14 - Set a user's thumbnail  
15 - Delete a user  
52 - View User details

:::  

To add a user to a business, you can either add them by email (once they have created an account) or use a [signup code](#signup-codes).  
Each user has a role group within the business that is defined by what [permissions](#permissions) they have. They can also have a Role in the business, which is a text entry that can have any value.  

## Permissions
---
AdamRMS has a granular permission system which lets you define exactly what a user can do.

:::note Permission Permissions
11 - Access list of roles and their permissions  
12 - Edit roles permissions [SUPER ADMIN]  
13 - Change a user's permissions  
16 - Add new roles  
:::

Throughout this guide permissions have been included in each section, but they are all listed on the permissions page.

Permissions are assigned to a Role Group, which can be created on a per-business basis. By default, businesses have an ‘Administrator’ Role group that has access to all permissions.


## Signup Codes
---
Signup codes are a way for individuals to automatically be added to your business as a specific role Group.

:::note Signup code permissions  
109 - View list of Signup Codes  
110 - Add new Signup Code  
111 - Edit Signup Code  
112 - Delete Signup Code  
:::

The code is the item users enter to get access to your business.  
AdamRMS tracks how many uses a code has had, and you can receive an email every time a signup code is used.
