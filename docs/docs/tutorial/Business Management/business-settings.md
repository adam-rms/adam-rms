## Public Site
---
AdamRMS supports a public site for each business, to allow information about business assets to be shared publicly.  
For example, this can be used to show what assets are available for hire.

The public site is an optional addon, but requires AdamRMS support to set up. Please get in touch if you would like to use this feature.

You can enable different pieces of information to be shared from the Public site settings page. The homepage can also be edited from this page, and supports HTML code editing. You can also provide a header image that is shown on each page.

There is also support for files to be hosted on your public site. This can be used for business brochures and venue information.

## Project Types
---
Project types are a way to change what elements of [Projects](../projects/projects) are available to each project. AdamRMS provides a “Full Project” by default which has all elements enabled.

Each Project is split into the following sections that can be enabled or disabled on a Project Type basis:
- Finance - Should asset charge calculations occur, and is billing enabled.
- Files - Can projects have files associated with them
- Assets - Assign assets to projects
- Client Assignment - Is this project associated with a client or an internal event.
- Venue - Associate a venue with this project.
- Notes - Use notes and comments in the project
- Crew - Use Crew assignment and recruitment in this project.

## Custom Categories
---
All Assets have an associated category that groups assets. AdamRMS comes with 29 sub-categories by default, but you can add new subcategories on a business basis.

- A parent Category.
