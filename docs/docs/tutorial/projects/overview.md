## Sub-projects
---
Projects can have associated sub-projects, which are linked to the main project. These sub-projects act as independent projects, but are linked for organisation.

![Example sub-project](/img/tutorial/projects/projects-subproject.png)
*An example subproject*

It is recommended you set up a new Project Type for sub-projects that excludes Finance, so that financial elements are only included in the main project.
