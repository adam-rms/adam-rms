## Asset Types
---
All assets are based on an asset type, which is owned by a manufacturer that can be added in a separate menu.  
To create a new asset type, select a manufacturer and then provide the following information:  
- Asset Name
- Asset Value
- Day & Week rates (suggested based on asset value)
- Asset Category

You can also provide additional information now, or update it later, including:
- Asset Description
- Product Link
- Mass
- Up to 10 definable fields

## Individual Assets
---
After creating an asset type, you can create individual assets of that asset type.
Each asset can have additional information:
- Asset notes, eg when the asset was purchased
- Values for the asset type definable fields
- [Asset Groups](./asset-groups)
- Asset Tags
  - Asset Tags can be auto-generated (will be A-XXXX) or entered manually.
  - See [Asset Barcodes](./asset-barcodes) for more information.

You can add multiple assets at once, and the tags will be added sequentially.
