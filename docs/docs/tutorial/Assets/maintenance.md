# Maintenance

Asset Maintenance is a way to track issues with assets as well as managing compliance such as PAT and LOLER.

All maintenance jobs are associated with an asset and can be assigned to a user.

All Jobs need:
- A job title
- Description of the fault
- Associated Asset(s)
- Job Priority

Once the job has been created, there is additional information that can be added:
- Job Assignment - Give the job to a user to fix
- Flag - Notify project managers that there is a fault with the assets in the job
- Block - Stop the asset from being assigned to projects
- Due Date
- Watching Users - Users can watch a job to receive updates on progress

Each of these fields has a dedicated permission.


## Managing Jobs
---
Progress on a job can be logged using the job thread. This can be in the form of a text entry or by uploading files to the job.
It can also be tracked by updating the job status.
